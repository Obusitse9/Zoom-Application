This application was developed for UCT 2020 Engineering Systems Design Course. The purpose of the course was to come up with a soltion to the high accident rate involving motorcycles. Our specific chosen target market is motorcycle delivery drivers. After conducting interviews with drivers and businesses, we found that delivery drivers often accepted multiple dilveries from multiple delivery platfroms. This resulted in instances of drivers disregarded road regulations and safety habits as they attempted to navigate amd ensure on time deliveries to all their delivery locations

Our suggest solution was to provide a single application that provided the best possible routes between all delivery locations on multiple platforms. This seeks to decrease the amount of stress for the user in finding an optimal route and potentially being late for a delivery, ultimately improving adherence to driving regualtions and safety habits.
